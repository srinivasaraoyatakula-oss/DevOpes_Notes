ps -ef -> list all the process running
top -> it will display live process with cpu and ram

kill PID -> request to terminate
kill -9 PID -> order to terminate

netstat -lntp -> shows the ports openend and PID

Database -> Application -> Web -> Load Balancer -> User

CRUD
======
1. Create operation
2. Read operation
3. Update operation
4. Delete operation

amazon.in

devops-practice -> AMI(Amazon Machine image)

What is image == image is everything around us
Image = OS + Some required softwares

Linux is OS or Kernel?
=======================
Linus Torwalds -> Linux and Git

Mac -> Hardware + MacOS
Dell -> Hardware + OS(Optional) -> we have freedom to install any OS

dominating OS for servers was Unix
Unix -> Hardware+UnixOS

He completely developed a Kernel from the scratch using C language. 

Kernel = a component that connects with Hardware
OS = Kernel + some utilities or applications for user

Centos, Fedora, Ubuntu, Android, Oracle Suse, Redhat

Redhat Family
==============
Opensource vs Enterprise

Opensource -> free and community driven. we need to wait for fix
Enterprise -> We pay money for support. if there are defects immidiately we get help

Enterprise = Opensource + Support

Redhat = Kernel + Application Utilities + Support

Amazon Linux == Redhat == Centos == Fedora == Almalinux

devops-practice = RHEL based

username=ec2-user 
Password=DevOps321

34.228.199.227

ssh ec2-user@34.228.199.227

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

A -> Z -> Y -> C -> D -> E

Database
==============
Database Server -> it is physical server
Server == Box == Node

database server software should be installed

RDBMS -> relational database management system
Excel -> Rows and Columns = Sheets
RDBMS = Rows and Columns = Tables

There is a relation between tables

MySQL, MSSQL Admin, Oracle Admin,
3306 -> MySQL port number

default admin username == root
password needs to setup

mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1

IP, port, protocol, username and password/key

https
IP/facebook.com
username
password
443

mysql  -u root -p<password>

-p<password> -> nospace between p and password

mysql -u root -pExpenseApp@1

Database Linux Server -> Database Server Installation -> Schema/databases -> tables -> Data

Application Tier
================
dnf module disable nodejs -y -> Disabling default nodejs version
dnf module enable nodejs:20 -y -> enable especially node js 20

dnf install nodejs -y

dnf is the next version of yum

useradd expense
system users or service accounts -> non human users

mkdir /app
