Forward vs Reverse proxy
=========================

Forward proxy
============
client side(anonymous identity)
provide restricted access
traffic control
	Laptop -> VPN(company proxy)(block facebook, instagram, etc.)
	
Reverse proxy
=============
hide server identity(security reasons)
SSL termination
Caching server

Laptop -> ISP -> Download the movie from torrents -> Cache into ISP servers

Nginx is used as reverse proxy as well as load balancer

upstream frontend {
        server frontend-1.daws86s.fun;
        server frontend-2.daws86s.fun;
    }

Nouns 		 and 	Verbs
Namavachakam and 	Kriya

CRUD(Verbs i.e action on resources/nouns)

DELETE

delete entire data

/usr/share/nginx/html
/etc/nginx
/var/log -> Linux logs directory
/var/log/nginx -> nginx log directory

/var/log/messages -> backend logs


systemctl status
ps -ef
netstat

telnet IP port-no
inspect and check
/var/log/nginx
/var/log/messages

nslookup
curl http://localhost:8080/health

inode symlink and hardlink
============================

softlink -> shortcut

c:\ProgramFiles\chrome.exe

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobatek\MobaXterm\"

symlink is a shortcut to actual file
inodes are diff for symlink and actual file
deleting the actual file will not delete symlink, but it breaks

hardlink
==========
same inode since pointing to same file in storage
deleting hardlink will not delete the actual file
