uid=1001(suresh) gid=1001(suresh) groups=1001(suresh)

when you create user in Linux, by default it will create one group with same username

/etc/passwd
suresh:x:1001:1001::/home/suresh:/bin/bash

/etc/group
devops:x:1002:

/etc/shadow -> encrypted password

A user in Linux must have 1 primary group and atleast 1 secondary group

usermod -g <group-name> <user-name> --> adding suresh to devops group
usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name> --> adding suresh to secondary group

passwd <user-name>

/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> SSH configuration
