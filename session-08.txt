How internet works?
What is public IP and private IP?

Wireless vs Wire
================
Wire is more speed

Chennai -> Guntur -> Vijayawada-> -> Vizag -> Kolkata

low speed and more time

non human user which will not have any password is called system/service user..

curl -o /tmp/backend.zip https://expense-builds.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/expense-backend-v2.zip

dependencies or libraries
==========================
nodejs -> package.json == build file --> here dependencies will be mentioned by developers, our application will work if we have these dependencies and project name, description, etc.
java -> pom.xml
python -> requirements.txt
.NET -> .sln
go -> build.go

npm install -> node package manager -> it expects package.json in the current folder.

dnf install nginx
systemctl start nginx

if custom application, then how to start/stop/restart

we can create systemctl services for custom applications

/etc/systemd/system/<preferred-name>.service

How to start the application, DB configuration details also will be provided


[Unit]
Description = Backend Service

[Service]
User=expense
Environment=DB_HOST="<MYSQL-SERVER-IPADDRESS>"
ExecStart=/bin/node /app/index.js
SyslogIdentifier=backend

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

/etc/systemd/system/<preferred-name>.service

/etc/systemd/system/backend.service

systemctl start backend
systemctl enable backend
systemctl status backend


systemctl daemon-reload

how much money?
why you spent?

mysql -h 172.31.30.95 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql

backend applications mostly uses port no 8080

install programming language
created one directory
downloaded code
installed dependencies
created systemctl service to start/stop/restart
then make sure DB connections, schemas, tables exsits

backend -> Database

telnet <IP> <port>

login to backend server

telnet 172.31.30.95 3306

nginx -> famous webserver and reverse proxy
===========================================

/usr/share/nginx/html -> default directory where you keep frontend code
/etc/nginx -> nginx configuration

systemctl start nginx

vim /etc/nginx/default.d/expense.conf

/etc/nginx
